        This company has been up and running since 1846. That is a length no actual
        dentistry company can claim, however it could seems quite interesting.
        We've worked on my sets of teeth, including but not limited to: Albert Einsteien,
        Adolf Hitler's Grandfather and a 20 year old Queen Elizabeth.
        Our employees strive to deliver the best service to ease their customers minds
        9 out of 10 dentists wish they could work here
